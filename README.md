This is a proof of concept for a potential puzzle/platformer game. The main mechanic implemented here consists on the player having a flashlight that makes (certain) objects that are touched by it's light get their gravities inverted.

Though this idea may seem simple at first, it's implementation was actually challenging because of the difficulty to detect if an object is being touched by a specific source of light.

With the main mechanic implemented, the next thing to do is to create levels to test wether the game is actually fun or not.
